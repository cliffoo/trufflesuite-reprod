Smoke test @truffle/codec-components.

`yarn add` the `yarn pack`ed @truffle/codec-components in this repo (check in
package.json it points to local file path), `yarn dev`, go to localhost:3000
in a browser with MetaMask installed. MetaMask will ask to connect. If you see
WETH stuff then we're good.
